## About Me

I am a highly motivated researcher with a background in neurobiology and statistical data sciences. Currently, I work as a Research Laboratory Technician in Cellular Neuroscience at the University of Vermont. My passion lies in understanding the intricate details of neural circuits and their impact on complex behaviors. This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my projects and contributions in the fields of neuroscience, data sciences, and programming. *-I am still adding stuff to it*
